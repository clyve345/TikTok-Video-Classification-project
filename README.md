# Project Title
Video Classification for Misinformation Mitigation on TikTok

## Objective:
Utilizing Python, developed a machine learning model aimed at discerning between factual claims and opinions presented in videos on the TikTok platform. The objective of this project was to streamline the process of identifying potentially misleading content, thereby reducing the backlog of user reports and enabling more efficient prioritization of moderation efforts to mitigate the spread of misinformation.

I used Machine Learning models such Random Forest and XGBoost for the classification.

Other than video classification, I do data cleaning, EDA and visualization to understand and prepare the data for analysis and modelling.
