### Project Title
TikTok Video Classification

# Objective:
Using Python to build a machine learning model to help identify if videos are claims or opinions. This can help to reduce the backlog of user reports to prioritize them more efficiently and to mitigate misinformation in videos on the TikTok platform.

I used Machine Learning models such Random Forest and XGBoost for the classification.

Other than video classification, I do data cleaning, EDA and visualization to understand and prepare the data for analysis and modelling.
